      <p>Personal branding isn't too different from product branding, except the entity being branded is you. Just as
        Nike
        uses their tick to attach a personality and uniqueness to their products, an individual's personal brand is made
        up of their unique qualities and traits (Skellie 2008, p.5). Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon communicates
        personal connections and human emotions as the core of self-branding (Tim Leberecht 2012). He states, "your
        brand
        is what other people say about you when you're not in the room".</p>
      <p>The importance of self-branding for freelance graphic designers can often be overlooked in today's
        hyperconnected
        world, as many people don't realise the great benefits that can come from it. With millions of freelance graphic
        designers worldwide, Skellie (2008, p.5) reflects on the significance of being able to capture people's
        attention
        and not just be another speck in the crowd.</p>
      <p>This project, Me Inc. was developed as Peters (1997) highlighted the new brand world we live in. He stated
        that,
        "we are CEOs of our own companies: Me Inc. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head
        marketer
        for the brand called You".</p>
      <p>This project examines the two underling concepts of personal branding developed by Karen Kang, through the
        metaphor of the "cake" and the "icing" (Reid 2015), as a foundation to explore the question "what are the
        benefits
        and challenges of online self-branding for graphic designers?".</p>
      <p>Peters (1997) stated that personal branding is "that simple - and that hard", Kang examined how individuals can
        discover and advance their self-brand through rational values, the "cake", that articulate what one's self-brand
        is about (such as experience and expertise), and the emotional values, the "icing", as the unique personality
        and
        soft skills of one's self-brand (such as personality and image) (Reid 2015). To convey a strong self-brand,
        individuals need to achieve a balance between the "cake" and the "icing".</p>
      <p>However, Labrecque, Markos & Milne (2010, p.38) reveal that personal branding can entail some unique challenges
        that mainly stem from the complexities in the online environment. Peters (1997) states that "everyone has a chance to be a brand worthy of remark", but if not created and
        maintained correctly the power is given to someone else in the same field.</p>
      <p>Peter (2007), Kang (in Reid 2015) and Labrecque, Markos & Milne's (2010) findings are examined in the following
        section, where in-depth interviews were conducted with four freelance graphic designers across Sydney. The
        participants were asked a range of questions in order to learn about their online and self-branding behaviour,
        including the benefits and challenges they have encountered.</p>
