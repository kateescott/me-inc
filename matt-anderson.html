          <p>Matt reflects on the concept of self-branding as a &ldquo;representation of morals and values held by a
            particular person&rdquo;. He states that they can be presented in a number of ways, but most commonly via
            social media, websites and face to face interactions.</p>
          <p>Matt demonstrates the influence of his rational values. He reflects on how his studies gave him the
            opportunity to grow into the freelance graphic designer that he is today. He reflects on his journey stating
            that he mostly &ldquo;fell into it&rdquo;, as he was approached for a wide range of products at the
            conclusion of his studies, and these have continued to grow ever since.</p>
          <p>Matt&rsquo;s emotional values are revealed through his unique skill set which he describes as &ldquo;precise,
            motivated and distilled&rdquo;. He uses his personal website to form the core of his branding and to present
            himself honestly and consistently. He states that maintaining a consistent self-brand &ldquo;is pretty
            straight forward when it comes from one person who is speaking true to who they are&rdquo;.</p>
          <p>For Matt, social media doesn&rsquo;t play a significant part in branding himself online. He states that he
            has never been the type to actively work on and maintain his presence across these platforms, using them
            more as an enforcer of personal and face to face interactions. Matt prides himself of the level of detail
            and care that he puts into projects and suggests that this contributed to increased clientele from word of
            mouth recommendations. Matt believes that if he is more active on social media it could pay dividends.</p>
          <p>Matt reflects on how he was lucky to have clients from day one but states that due to this he never really
            developed a reliance on creating a personal brand. Although he always had work coming in it was often
            challenging and he states that &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t always things I was interested in working on &ndash;
            no dream clients per say&rdquo;.</p>
