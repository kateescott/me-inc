      <p>The findings demonstrate the reflexive approach that freelance graphic designers take in self-branding online.
        As illustrated, constructing a self-brand can pose many challenges but if, and when, handled correctly can have
        many benefits.</p>

      <p>By examining the two underlying concepts, the rational and emotional values, or the &ldquo;cake and the icing&rdquo;,
        Kang (in Lewinter 2013) outlines how individuals can develop a strong self-brand. She state&rsquo;s that
        self-branding is easy to understand &ldquo;you just have to bake the cake, then ice it&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>As evidenced by the participants, there are many different tactics to create and maintain a brand whether it be
        social networking profiles, personal website, and blogs, or the use of search engine optimisation techniques
        (Labrecque, Markos &amp; Milne 2010, p.39). The most important elements is to ensure that these platforms
        capture and promote the individual&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. Due to the nature of the online environment
        challenges can arise, and therefore it is important to ensure consistency and authenticity is displayed
        (Labrecque, Markos &amp; Milne 2010, p.39).</p>

      <p>With participants all expressing the involvement of personal values in developing their self-brand and
        undertaking freelance work, it is interesting to explore the different outcomes, benefits and challenges that
        each participant has faced.</p>

      <p>Melissa achieved a balanced between the &ldquo;cake&rdquo; and the &ldquo;icing&rdquo;. She is perceived as an
        environmental activist demonstrating her rational values as a humanitarian, and her emotional values as someone
        who cares and is passionate about what they do. She illustrated how she has overcome her challenges that online
        self-branding has presented her, and reflects on the positive outcomes of this.</p>

      <p>Like Melissa, Matt has also achieved a balance between the &ldquo;cake&rdquo; and the &ldquo;icing&rdquo;. Matt
        demonstrates his rational values through his experience and expertise. His emotional values are illustrated
        through his precision, motivation and distillation. By speaking true to who he is, Matt should continuously
        drive to develop his authentic brand focusing particularly on the development of online aspects (Labrecque,
        Markos &amp; Milne 2010, p.39).</p>

      <p>Paprika on the other hand, demonstrates her rational values through her real and honest-self brand. However,
        she reflects on challenges of presenting her &lsquo;honest-self&rsquo; across different social media accounts.
        By placing more emphasis on her emotional values, such as things she&rsquo;s involved in and passionate about,
        Paprika could improve her social relations and reputation online (Gandini 2015, p.124).</p>

      <p>Nicholas takes a different approach, his rational values demonstrated his talent as he publishes content and
        work samples across his social media platforms and personal website. Similarly to Paprika, Nicholas could focus
        on promoting his &lsquo;likability and trust&rsquo; to further improve these emotional values which could in
        turn increase organic reach.</p>

      <p>This research offers key insights into the phenomena of self-branding online for freelance graphic designers.
        The investigation highlights the different benefits and challenges that individuals face in the process of
        self-branding in an online environment. It puts forwards, the importance of branding in communicating who you
        are and what you do, and demonstrates that by identifying rational and emotional values present, freelance
        graphic designers are able to realise the potential of self-branding, and the positive or negative outcomes that
        may result from their actions.</p>
