          <p>Melissa is a young designer currently studying at university. Her concern and passion for the environment
            has led her to develop a self-brand that has enabled her to stand out amongst her competition and relate to
            something that is of importance and unique to her.</p>
          <p>Melissa&rsquo;s self-brand has contributed to her rational values of expertise and experience, as she has
            gained clients who have identified that they &ldquo;like what she is about&rdquo; after viewing her work on
            her website and social media accounts. She reflects on how this has helped her develop skills she requires
            for future employment.</p>
          <p>Her emotional values are demonstrated as she states that her self-brand is of extreme importance to her
            work as a freelancer, giving her the ability to show her personality without meeting her. She states that,
            &ldquo;it lets an employer know about my values, my humour, my everything. It&rsquo;s me in brand form&rdquo;.</p>
          <p>However, self-branding wasn&rsquo;t an entirely positive journey for Melissa. She encountered difficulties
            in presenting her brand consistently online, specifically in terms of maintaining a certain appearance and
            colour palette across different media platforms. She stated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a lot of work and being up
            and happy all the time is sometimes hard&rdquo;.</p>
          <p>Melissa strived to overcome these challenges, as she began implementing a consistent logo across her social
            media accounts. She continues to maintain a clean-look, comprised of a &lsquo;faded&rsquo; colour palette
            with witty captions, such as &ldquo;stop sucking&rdquo; for the image shown, to compliment the seriousness
            of the issues she&rsquo;s demonstrating.</p>
