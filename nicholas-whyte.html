          <p>Nicholas&rsquo; reflects on how self-branding &ldquo;represents the image you want to perceive to others&rdquo;,
            using his self-brand as a ladder to escape the average and help potential clients perceive him as the person
            they are looking for (Skellie 2008, p.5). He describes the uniqueness and approachability of his brand as
            quirky, bright and professional.</p>
          <p>Nicholas is driven through the flexibility and nature of freelance work. He finds that freelance work gives
            him the ability to take on inspiring jobs that align with his values. Nicholas reflects on the important of
            his self-brand as he states, &quot;having a personal brand has allowed me to experiment and learn the best
            ways to portray the services I provide&rdquo;. He primarily uses his website to portray his self-brand,
            often publishing content such as work samples to increase search engine optimisation (SEO) value.</p>
          <p>In the process of branding online, Nicholas reflects on how he struggled to obtain organic reach, with
            difficulties finding time to focus on marketing and increase discoverability. He also states that &ldquo;at
            times it is hard to look legitimate&rdquo;. However, when achieved appropriately a positive reputation can
            be obtained helping to obtain additional work, specifically from work of mouth, as he reflects that a
            &ldquo;negative reputation would have a detrimental to my freelance work&rdquo;.</p>
